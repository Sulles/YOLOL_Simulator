# YOLOL Simulator
This project strives to simulate the interaction between YOLOL code and all objects within its network

#### Controls:
- Left-click sends 'action' to object (one for Down, and one for Up)
- Right-click-down snaps nearest object to cursor
- Right-click-up releases selected object

### This project uses CYLON AST v0.3.0
- YOLOL AST Constructor provided by yoloxide: https://github.com/Jerald/yoloxide
- Current use of this program requires using Discord bot to get CYLON AST, would be nice to have a back-end

## Completed

### CYLON AST To Python Converter v0.1 (100% complete)
- Could use better unit tests

## Working on...

### Pygame Simulator Framework (35% complete)
- GUI (15%)
- Displaying Devices (50%)

### Integrate Pythonized Yolol Code into Simulator through YOLOL Chips (0% complete)

### Automate YOLOL to CYLON AST to Python (30% complete - waiting on Yoloxide backend)

### Create UI to create Network with specific components (5% complete)
It will be possible to create custom 'textures' for all components. Need to implement this with setup.

### Python Emulator Object Classes and Network (5% complete)
